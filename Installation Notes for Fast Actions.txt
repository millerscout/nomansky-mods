Hi and thanks for trying my mods.

Please follow these steps in order to install this mod.

Installation :
- remove or rename DISABLEMODS.TXT file from PCBANKS folder (I rename it into ENABLEMODS.TXT)
- create a MODS folder into \Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\No Man's Sky\GAMEDATA\PCBANKS folder
- copy/paste included .pak file into this MODS folder


Merging mods using AMUMSS (if you have other .lua mods that could conflict with this one) :
- copy the .lua file provided into AMUMSS' ModScript folder
- add your other .lua mods in this same folder
- change the path toward your NMS installation in AMUMSS' NMS_FOLDER.txt file
- Click on BuildMod.bat and follow the steps
- Find your final .pak file in AMUMSS' CreatedModPak folder and install it as specified above.


That's all.

Enjoy :)
